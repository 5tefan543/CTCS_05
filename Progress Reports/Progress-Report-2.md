### What we did after the last meeting

1. Integrated our HelloWorld program from before into the automatic Benchmarking-Framework.
2. Fixed 'ZXing' Benchmark, and readded it to the Benchmarking Framework.
3. Added a new Benchmark, 'Mandelbrot', to the Benchmarking Framework.
4. Tested Enerj for a 2D HeatStencil application but found it to be unsuitable for the task.
5. Collecting research data on recent approximation strategies focuing on energy savings. A lot of useful research was found for memory approximation strategies, but not much for computation approximation strategies. Research by far not complete.
6. Started preparing the presentation slides.

### Next Steps ?

Ways we could see to move forward in our project:

- Optimizing the newly implemented benchmarks.
- Finishing the presentation slides.
- Start writing the final report.
- Continue researching approximation strategies and energy savings as well as energy models?
- Implementing more benchmarks?
